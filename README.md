FaviconDart
===========

FaviconDart is a proof of concept Dartlang based favicon animator. It currently works on Chrome, Firefox and Opera. 

I currently havent gotten around to putting this up on the package manager nor proper documentation as I would like to make it more stable and more usable before I do so.
Nothing worse than having libraries which are incomplete being used in the wild.
